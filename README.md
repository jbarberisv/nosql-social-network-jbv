# nosql-social-network-jbv

## Description 

I developed a back-end API using MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node Express JS for a social network application. It includes CRUD endpoints for Users and Thoughts, with additional features for managing user's Friends and thought's Reactions. Choosing NoSQL over SQL allowed flexibility during development, but handling updates for deleted users and related thoughts across collections posed challenges.
